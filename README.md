Food Ordering Mobile App UI
This project contains the design files for a food ordering mobile application created using Figma. The design showcases an intuitive user interface that allows users to browse through a menu of dishes and make selections for their order.

Features
Menu Overview: A scrollable list of dishes with thumbnails, names, and prices.
Detailed View: Selecting a dish opens its detailed view with an appetizing image, full description, price information, and an ‘Add to Cart’ button.
